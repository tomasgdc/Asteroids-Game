Sony Manchester Programming Test

This test is designed to give you the opportunity to show off your 
programming skill in a more fun & realistic scenario than your typical 
interview session.  Included is an unfinished version of the classic 
arcade game Asteroids.  There several features missing which we'd like you 
add as listed below.  All the source is included in this zip, which should 
compile out of the box and includes everything you need.  

The features we'd like you to complete are:-

* Add collision detection & response, currently you don't die & can't hit 
any asteroids, which is obviously boring!

* You can't tell how many lives are left & there's no score, please add.

* The source code is a bit untidy & could do with better comments, please 
add where appropriate.

* Currently the game is pretty basic, can you add something to make it 
better?  Feel free to add anything you think is missing but don't feel you 
have to spend too much time.

It shouldn't take much above 3-4 hours to complete the test, so please 
don't feel you need to spend any more time than that (though you're of 
course free to do that if you wish).  Just return your finished code when 
complete and let us know how long it took you (honestly!).  

Thanks & good luck!
